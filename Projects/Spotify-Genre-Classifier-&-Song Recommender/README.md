# Spotify Genre Classifier & Song Recommender
- Created a Spotify song genre classifier & song recommender that takes a track and integer K as input and recommends the top K similar songs to the user input
- Applied various supervised learning models that classify tracks into their appropriate genres based on Kaggle dataset of tracks with genres and attributes such as tempo, valence, etc.
- Built functions to access and extract features from track data in the Spotify API if track data was not already present in the dataset
